# Linear Regression Analysis

[Book link](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/Linear+Regression+Analysis%2C+2nd+Edition-p-9780471415404). By George A. F. Seber and Alan J. Lee.

[Org-mode notes](/linear-regression-analysis/notes.org) are best viewed in emacs, where the command `C-u C-u C-c C-x C-l` generates all formulas inline.

The book has answers to exercises in the back already, and they're very well written, so I won't repeat them here!
