However, these paths cannot include any variable $X_r^{k}$ with $k\\neq j$, since that would create a summary graph cycle. Thus there is some minimal parent $X_{t-s'}^j$ with $s'\\le s$ adjacent to $X_t^j$.\n",

The instantaneous effects form a DAG and the joint is Markovian and faithful with respect to the fulltime graph. To what extent can one identify the instananeous DAG structure from the distribution across time?_\n",

    "In the iid sample model, we can recognize DAG structure under various scenarios, assuming restricted model classes (which ban conditional distributions or assign proposed structures which requires conditional distributions not fitting within the class a bad fit) or by testing independence (let's assume we're in a fully observable setting for now).\n",

If this chain is ergodic then in theory we can perform the same estimations that are used for independence testing in DAG identifiability using MCMC samples. We'd expect a reduced efficiency from sample autocorelation quantified from [Markov Chain CLT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_central_limit_theorem). But the idea is that you could just take a hit in effective sample size but still sample from the same chain.\n",
