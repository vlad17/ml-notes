# ML Notes

* [Elements of Causal Inference](element-causal-inference/README.md) by Jonas Peters, Dominik Janzing, and Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf
* [Linear Regression Analysis](linear-regression-analysis/README.md) by George A. F. Seber and Alan J. Lee.
* [Deep Learning](deep-learning/README.md) by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville.

While they're not textbooks, I also strongly recommend [Sinho Chewi's Theoretical Statistics notes](https://chewisinho.github.io/). Those follow most of [Theoretical Statistics](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-93839-4) by Robert W. Keener and parts of [Asymptotic Statistics](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/asymptotic-statistics/A3C7DAD3F7E66A1FA60E9C8FE132EE1D) by A. W. van der Vaart for Berkeley courses 210A and 210B, respectively.
