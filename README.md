# ML Notes

These notes are a dedicated collection of condensed educational materials relating to machine learning (ML). I hope that eventually they will contain a comprehensive, rigorous overview of practical and theoretical concerns for machine learning, ultra-compacted (but with links everywhere for deep-diving!). The goal here isn't to fully recount all the notes, just to give a brief overview and index of existing work useful for a high-level view of a topic.

Prerequisites:

* Probability theory (formal preferred; elementary required)
* Linear algebra

Topics:

* [Idiosyncrasies](idiosyncrasies.pdf)
* Theoretical Statistics (Information Theory and Estimation Theory)
* [Statistical learning theory](statistical-learning/README.md)
* [Common models (and their considerations) for ERM-based supervised learning](supervised/README.md)
* [Bayesian-motivated unsupervised learning](unsupervised/README.md)
* [Deep Learning](deep-learning/README.md)
* Optimization concerns
* RKHS and kernel methods [overview](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space)
